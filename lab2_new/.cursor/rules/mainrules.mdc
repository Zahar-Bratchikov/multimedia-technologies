# Strict Coding Standards

## Main Rules

1. **Do not delete or modify existing working functionality** unless explicitly required by the technical specification (TS).
2. **Do not write temporary, demo, or placeholder functions.** Provide a complete, production-ready implementation immediately.
3. **Do not add comments suggesting future improvements or rewrites** (e.g., "this is a demo function, needs to be rewritten later").
4. **Strictly follow the technical specification.** Avoid assumptions, guesswork, or speculative additions.
5. **Do not make unnecessary changes** to already working code.
6. **Follow the existing architecture and coding style** of the project.
7. **Ensure full integration with existing code** â€” no isolated stubs or mockups.
8. **Do not suggest alternative approaches** unless explicitly asked in the TS.
9. **All responses and code comments must be in Russian.**
10. **Validate that new code does not break existing functionality** before finalizing the changes.

## Notes

- Always prioritize stability and reliability.
- Aim for clean, maintainable, and production-ready code.
- These rules help maintain consistency and avoid regressions in the codebase.
